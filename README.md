> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) CoStJaBrIfy generator

## Costja What?

CoStJaBrIfy stands for:
- CoffeeScript
- Stylus
- Jade
- BrowserSync
- Browserify

And its my preferred frontend stack at this time and it's probably soon yours too. This whole Repo is a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) Generator. If you don't know, what Yeoman is, you probably want to check it out first: [Yeoman Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started.)


## Quickstart

If you haven't met Yeoman yet, you probably want to invite him to your dev env:

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

After that, invite CoStJaBrIfy to the party:

```bash
npm install -g generator-costjabrify
```

Now, you can generate awesome frontend-stubs in seconds:

```bash
yo costjabrify
```
